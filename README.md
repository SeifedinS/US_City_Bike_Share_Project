### Project Title
Explore US Bike Share Data

### Description
In this project, I used Python programming language to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Besides, I did include a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
