### Date created
I have created this project in 18 March 2021 and added README file in 24 March 2021.

### Project Title
Explore US Bike Share Data

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Besides, I did include a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Software requirements
- You should have Python 3, NumPy, pandas, and tabulate installed using Anaconda
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
